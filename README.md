## Mitigating algorithmic bias
Watch the below video to get a insight about Human Bias and how it effects our Machine learning model.

## Variational autoencoder (VAE)
We can reduce the algorithmic Bias using VAE.It is an autoencoder whose encodings distribution is regularised during the training in    order to ensure that its latent space has good properties allowing us to generate some new data.
